Significant changes to the mmand package are laid out below for each release.

=================================================================================

VERSION 1.0.0

- The back-end code for the package has been completely rewritten, using C++ and
  Rcpp rather than C.
- The package can now perform image resampling, via resample(). This requires a
  different type of kernel but is conceptually related to the existing functions
  based on morph().
- The morph() function has been generalised to allow for various new operations.
  In the process, the concepts of "brush" and "eraser" kernels have been removed.
- 2D arrays (i.e. matrices or 2D images) can now be visualised using the new
  display() function.
- Functions for mean and median filtering have been added.
- There are additional functions for establishing whether an array is binary,
  and for obtaining information about the structure of a neighbourhood within
  an array.
- Kernels now have a plot() method.
- The classical image processing test image, "lena", has been added to the
  package.
- A suite of tests has been added.

=================================================================================

VERSION 0.1.2

- Brush kernels which include NAs, notably diamond-shaped kernels, are now
  properly handled by the C code. The value of the output array was sometimes
  overwritten by that of the input array when it should not have been.
  
=================================================================================

VERSION 0.1.1

- A mistake in internal memory management which could lead to a segmentation
  fault has been corrected.

=================================================================================

VERSION 0.1.0

- First public release.
